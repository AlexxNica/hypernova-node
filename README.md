# hypernova-client

> A node client for sending requests to Hypernova.

## class Renderer

### Renderer.prototype.addPlugin

> (plugin: HypernovaPlugin)

Adds a plugin to the renderer.

### Renderer.prototype.render

> (data: Jobs): Promise<string>

Sends a request to Hypernova for the provided payload and returns a promise which will fulfill
with the HTML string you can pass down to the client.

## Example usage

```js
const express = require('express');
const Renderer = require('hypernova-client');
const devModePlugin = require('../plugins/devModePlugin');

const app = express();

const renderer = new Renderer({
  url: 'http://localhost:3553/batch',
  plugins: [
    devModePlugin,
  ],
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const jobs = {
    MyComponent: { name: req.query.name || 'Stranger' },
    Component2: { text: 'Hello World' },
  };

  renderer.render(jobs).then(html => res.send(html));
});

app.listen(8080, () => console.log('Now listening'));
```

## Plugin Lifecycle API

```typescript
function getViewData(viewName: string, data: any): any {}
```

Allows you to alter the data that a "view" will receive.

```typescript
type Job = { name: string, data: any };
type Jobs = { [string]: Job };
function prepareRequest(currentJobs: Jobs, originalJobs: Jobs): Jobs {}
```

A reducer type function that is called when preparing the request that will be sent to Hypernova.
This function receives the current running jobs Object and the original jobs Object.

```typescript
function shouldSendRequest(jobs: Jobs): boolean {}
```

An `every` type function. If one returns `false` then the request is canceled.

```typescript
function willSendRequest(jobs: Jobs): void {}
```

An event type function that is called prior to a request being sent.

```typescript
type Job = { name: string, data: any };
type Response = {
  [string]: {
    error: ?Error,
    html: string,
    job: Job,
  },
};
function afterResponse(currentResponse: any, originalResponse: Response): any {}
```

A reducer type function which receives the current response and the original response from the
Hypernova service.

```typescript
type Job = { name: string, data: any };
type Jobs = { [string]: Job };
function onSuccess(jobs: Jobs): void {}
```

An event type function that is called whenever a request was successful.

```typescript
type Job = { name: string, data: any };
type Jobs = { [string]: Job };
function onError(err: Error, jobs: Jobs): void {}
```

An event type function that is called whenever any error is encountered.

## Lifecycle Spec

1. Call `getViewData(name, data)` for every view provided.
  - 1.1 Use the return value as the `data` field's value for the Jobs Object.
2. Call `prepareRequest(currentJobs, originalJobs)` as a reducer.
  - 2.1 The return value becomes the new Jobs Object.
3. Call `shouldSendRequest(jobs)` and pass in the Jobs object.
  - 3.1 If `false`.
    * 3.1.1 Create a Response Object.
    * 3.1.2 The `html` attribute is the fallback client-rendered output.
    * 3.1.3 The `error` attribute should be `null`.
4. Call `willSendRequest(jobs)`.
  - 4.1 Submit the HTTP Request as a POST.
5. If any error occurs up until this point create a Response Object.
  - 5.1 The `error` attribute should equal the Error that was thrown.
  - 5.2 The `html` attribute is the fallback client-rendered output.
  - 5.3 Call `onError(error, jobs)`.
6. When a response is received from the server:
  - 6.1 Iterate over the response, if the `error` field is not null then call `onError(error, job)` per job.
7. Call `afterResponse(currentResponse, originalResponse)` as a reducer.
  - 7.1 Call `String()` on the result.
  - 7.2 If `afterResponse` is not defined then combine all of the response's `html` fields into a string.
8. If an error is encountered then return the string of HTML for client-rendering.
  - 8.1 Call `onError(error, jobs)`.
